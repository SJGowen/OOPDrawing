# OOPDrawing

This follows the exercise OOPDraw by Richard Pawson that my son was set as part of his A-Level Computer Studies.

The original program is licensed under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ so this is to.

As this project has progressed, I have not followed the tutorial step by step, adding extras as and when I see fit.
